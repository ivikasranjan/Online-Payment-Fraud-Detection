# 💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. By analyzing transaction features and behavior patterns, the model helps reduce financial risk and improve security in digital payment systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent payment transactions in real-time
- Improve fraud detection accuracy using machine learning algorithms
- Provide insights to enhance transaction security and prevent loss

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Online payment platforms face a growing threat of fraudulent transactions. Traditional rule-based systems fail to adapt to evolving fraud patterns. This project uses **ML classification models** to identify suspicious activity based on historical transaction data.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Analysis & Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn  
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, F1-Score  
- **Balancing Technique**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, data types, duplicates  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding patterns in fraudulent vs. genuine transactions  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Encoding categorical variables, scaling features  
4. **Model Building** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
5. **Balancing** – Applied **SMOTE** to address class imbalance  
6. **Evaluation** – Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
7. **Deployment-ready** – Code prepared for use in a Streamlit app or API

## ✅ Results

- Achieved high **recall and ROC-AUC** to ensure minimal false negatives  
- SMOTE effectively improved fraud detection performance on imbalanced data  
- Insights helped identify key indicators of fraud such as transaction amount, device type, and location  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with live transaction systems for real-time monitoring
- Add deep learning models like LSTM for sequence-based analysis
